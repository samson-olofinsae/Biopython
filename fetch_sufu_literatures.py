################  SCRIPT
###### This script extracts a lis of papers from the PubMed database using the search Term SUFU
# SUFU is a gene that is part of a cell signaling pathway involved in the formation of tissues and organs, cell growth, and cell division during embryonic development.
# Mutations (changes) in the SUFU gene may cause cells to grow and divide too quickly or in an uncontrolled way.

# Code Description: Object Oriented Programming: Functions, class, inheritance
'''"This script demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) by defining:
a TextDownloader class that encapsulates the logic for querying PubMed, retrieving article details, and writing the results to a text file.
It demonstrates how to define functions (methods) that belong to a given class.
It also illustrates inheritance by creating a ChildClass that inherits from TextDownloader,
showing how a child class can reuse and extend functionality from the parent class.
By organizing PubMed logic into modular methods, the code is more maintainable and reusable."'''

########### Demonstrating inheritance 


# Define the child class (ChildClass) that inherits from the parent class (TextDownloader).
# The child class inherits all functionality from the parent class and can also introduce its own unique methods.
# Inherited functionality include the __init__ and get_papers methods 

class ChildClass(TextDownloader):
    # Define a method unique to the child class (ChildClass).
    # This method is not part of the parent class and provides additional functionality specific to the child class.
    def Print(self):
        # Print a message from the method 'Print', which is unique to the child class.
        # This demonstrates behavior that is added in the child class, not inherited from the parent class.
        print("This line is printed from a method unique to the child class! De novo!")

####### Demonstrating Object Instantiation and Method Calling

# Create an instance of the child class, which inherits functionality from the parent class (TextDownloader)
# The email provided will be passed to the parent class's __init__ method, setting up Entrez.email.

inherited_class = ChildClass("youremail@youremail.com") # provide your email  

# Call the inherited method 'get_papers' from the parent class (TextDownloader)
# This method allows the child class object to search for papers related to the term "SUFU".
inherited_class.get_papers("SUFU")  # This will fetch papers related to the gene "SUFU"

# Call the method unique to the child class ('Print') that was defined in the child class (ChildClass)
# This method will print a message specific to the child class, showcasing behavior unique to it.
inherited_class.Print()  # ‚Üê This executes the method specific for the child - not inherited - de novo!
